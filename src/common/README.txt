============
Let's practice creating unit tests using two different methodologies:
    1. TDD (Test-driven Development): create a tests for a non-existent 
       Customer class, using requirements
    2. Test-Last: create tests for the Product class, improving it based
       on requirements
    3. When done with steps 1 and 2, create a test suite
